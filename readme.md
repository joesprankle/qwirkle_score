# Qwirkle Score

A web app used to score my family's favorite game built using Laravel.

## Getting Started

Clone the project repository by running the command below if you use SSH

```git clone git@github.com/joesprankle/qwirkle_score.git```

If you use https, use this instead

```git clone https://github.com/joesprankle/qwirkle_score.git```

## Setting Up
Setup your database and `cd` into the project directory then run:

```php artisan migrate```

Once the database is set up and migrations are up, run

```php artisan serve```

and visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the application in action.


## TODO

* Lots :-)
